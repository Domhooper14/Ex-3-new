    During the creation of this website I have come across many technical issues that I have had to overcome, because this is my first time doing this I had to learn as I go, I find this the best way to learn because when solving a problem you can very easily lose track of time and gain much more knowledge than other educational methods, When I first started designing the website I found the jumble of words on the screen to be very confusing, however over time while developing it I gained a much better understanding of the code and how it works.
    <ul></ul>
    As I continued on developing this site I got much more into it especially enjoying the design process, The main thing I struggled with during this process was making the website work for mobile, I originally started off trying to create a hamburger icon by creating it with just code  but I just could not get it to work so I did some research and found out how to use an image instead, this was much easier and allowed me to use this hamburger icon, after I worked this out I then struggled with having this image hidden on desktop and visible on mobile because after implementing the image it was visible on desktop as well as mobile, to fix this issue I placed the hamburger inside the aside section of the grid and had that section only visible on the mobile using the mobile CSS.
    <ul></ul>
    When designing the website I used coolors.co, this is a website that lets you find multiple colours that work well with each other, once I had found a set of colours I liked I then used these on my site, I feel this was a good decision because a good colour palette makes the website look much more professional as well as aesthetically pleasing.
On the main  page I have the title of my page next to the 4 different sections with an animated background, I did this because I wanted It to be like a map to the rest of the site, I feel that this is the best way to layout a personal website because it allows any visitors to see exactly what they can do instantly.
