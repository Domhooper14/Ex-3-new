Today I have added multiple new features to my website project, these features include adding all the main pages after deciding their layout as well as the aesthetic I wanted to follow, 
I decided on this using a website that gives colours that go well with each other, this is important because it will give the potential customer a better view of me and my work. 
The layout has been created to allow users to be able to always access any page on the website making it extremely easy to use, this is crucial in keeping a user’s attention.

    During my work on the website today I have linked all the pages together using HREF, this allows users to click on the label for a page e.g. “Portfolio” and they will be taken to that page, 
    this gives my website a better ability to convey information via multiple pages, without this the website would be very cramped due to the lack of space available.
     I have also added an animated background image to the main page, so it looks more like an introductory page to the website.

    Today I have made more progress on the website, I have completed the base structure for all the web pages and am starting to work on the content, 
    The part I am finding most difficult currently is ideas on how to make my website seem more professional.
